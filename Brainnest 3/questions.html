            <li class="question">What rules should you follow when naming variables?<br>
                <em>The name must contain only letters, digits, or the symbols $ and _

            <li class="question">Explain the difference between == and ===.<br>

            </li>
            <li class="question">When would you receive a NaN result?<br>

                operators.<br>
                <em>Postfix the expression is evaluated first then value is incremented or decremented, prefix the value is chanegd before the expression is evaluated. </em>

            <li class="question">What is operator precedence and how is it handled in JS?<br>
                <em>Operator precedence determines how operators are parsed concerning each other. Operators with higher precedence become the operands of operators with lower precedence. </em>
